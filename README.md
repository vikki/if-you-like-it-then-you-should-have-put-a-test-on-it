# If You Like It Then You Should Have Put A Test On It - Front End Acceptance Test Frameworks Comparison

This repo is for the purposes of comparing front end acceptance test frameworks, as there are a few out there now, and they're all similar but different, and TBH I was having trouble keeping track :P This isn't here to keep score or find the *best* one; I genuinely think they're all pretty great, and this is a problem that is very much worth solving, and hugely appreciate the work that's gone into them all. However some might suit your use-case more than others, and I hadn't found that [spelt](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/5712/spelt-vs-spelled) out anywhere, so I thought I'd made one. Enormously inspired by [TodoMVC](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc).

Currently tracking :

- [theintern](http://theintern.io)
- [nightwatchjs](http://nightwatchjs.org)

Each library I've covered has a folder at the top level, with all the tests I have available under there. As testing setup can be a bit complicated, with Grunt/Gulp/Broccoli setup jazz, framework config files, and dependent resources, I will add feature branches for each task, so its easier to see how to replicate a particular setup.

Check the branches for currently available list for current available setups.
