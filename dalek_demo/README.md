## This branch
This is the **Custom-Asserts** branch, and you're in the **dalek_demo** folder, so here we'll demonstrate tests using custom asserts in dalek. To see what else is available go back to [master](https://github.com/vikki/if-you-like-it-then-you-should-have-put-a-test-on-it/tree/master).
So currently Dalek doesn't really have an API for adding custom asserts but it is possible


## Running the tests
### Global Dependencies
First install the dalek CLI npm package globally:

 	npm install dalek-cli -g


Dalek doesn't need an external selenium server running, so we're all set now.

### Project dependencies
Then install the project level dependencies, specified in npm:

	npm install

### Actually running the tests
Now you're ready to actually run the tests! Do this with:
	
	npm test

Happy testing! <3
